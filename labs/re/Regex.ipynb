There should be an arrow in the start node pointing back on its own, i.e. if a character other than an upper case \"M\" has been processed, the machine should stay in the start condition. Furthermore, there should be an arrow pointing back from all nodes except the final nodes (the green ones) to the start node, if not the expected letter has been processed. E.g. if the machine is in state Ma, after having processed a \"M\" and an \"a\", the machine has to go back to state \"Start\", if any character except \"i\" or \"y\" can be read. Those who have problems with this FSM, shouldn't be bothered, because it is not necessary to understand it for the things to come. "
